### What I learned

Watching Kevin Powell build this Website on Scrimba exposed me to a lot CSS properties i have never encountered, I am Super happy i came across this challenge. My CSS knowledge has improved more just finishing this challenge. My Confident level is really high. 

Working smarter and faster was Kevin Powell's importan message to me in this challenge. To be honest, I thought the code was going to longer than this.

I learnt new CSS properties like clamp, padding-block, padding-inline, the use of rem, em and ch too. it's a lot. I'm happy.

### Continued development

I look forward to keep improving my CSS  and Javascript skills by applying what i have learnt from Kevin Powell and this Challenge.
